===== MODEL 1: Q4 SPEND PREDICTION =====

Purpose: Predict how much customers will spend in Q4 2024
Type: Regression (XGBoost)

Test RMSE: $10657.74
R² Score: 0.944
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): Measures the standard deviation of prediction errors
R² Score: Proportion of variance in the dependent variable predictable from the independent variables
  - 1.0 is perfect prediction
  - 0.0 means the model is no better than predicting the mean

Quarterly Spending Statistics:
  Average spend_2024_q1: $971.03
  Average spend_2024_q2: $15748.62
  Average spend_2024_q3: $16636.18
  Average predicted Q4 spend: $19850.78

Q4 spend is projected to be 78.5% higher than the average of previous quarters
This reflects the holiday shopping effect using a data-driven holiday multiplier of 1.25x
(based on median customer-level Q4 vs Q1-Q3 spending patterns)

Feature Importance Analysis:

Key features for Q4 spend prediction:
  holiday_spending_power - Combines holiday multiplier (1.25x) with income level and spending history
  avg_monthly_spend_2024 - Average monthly spending pattern for 2024
  total_spend_2024 - Total annual spend, indicates customer's overall buying power

Top Feature Importances:
  credit_score: 0.384
  utilization_pct: 0.233
  payment_hist_1_12_delinquency_count: 0.080
  payment_hist_13_24_delinquency_count: 0.050
  has_fraud: 0.049
  current_balance: 0.047
  credit_line: 0.047
  is_high_income: 0.042
  total_spend_2024: 0.013
  total_spend_2025YTD: 0.013

Key Drivers of Segmentation:
  Credit score and utilization_pct are dominant factors in determining customer segments
  Payment history (delinquencies) plays a significant role
  Fraud history is a strong signal for higher risk segments

===== MODEL 3: RISK FLAGGING =====

Purpose: Identify high-risk customers who should not receive credit line increases
Type: Binary Classification (XGBoost)

Risk Distribution Results:
  Risk 0: 16591 accounts (92.00%)
  Risk 1: 1442 accounts (8.00%)

Risk Model Performance Metrics:
  Test Accuracy: 83.89%
  ROC AUC: 0.647

Classification Report:
Not Risky (0):
  Precision: 0.94
  Recall: 0.88
  F1-score: 0.91

Risky (1):
  Precision: 0.22
  Recall: 0.41
  F1-score: 0.29

Metric Notes:
  ROC AUC: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. Measures the ability to
  discriminate between risky and non-risky customers. 1.0 is perfect, 0.5 is random guessing.
  Low precision for risky class (0.22) indicates many false positives, but this is expected and
  acceptable in fraud/risk detection where missing a risky customer is more costly than
  misclassifying a non-risky one.

Top Feature Importances for Risk Flagging:
  utilization_pct: 0.335
  payment_hist_13_24_max_delinquency: 0.109
  credit_score: 0.094
  current_balance: 0.085
  delinquency_12mo: 0.083
  delinquency_24mo: 0.072
  payment_hist_1_12_max_delinquency: 0.064
  credit_line: 0.054
  total_spend_2025YTD: 0.044
  total_spend_2024: 0.031

Risk Assessment Insights:
  Utilization percentage is the strongest predictor of risk
  Historical delinquency data (both recent and older) heavily influences risk assessment
  Credit score is an important but not dominant factor in determining risk
  Current balance relative to credit line impacts risk evaluation

    * Fair credit (650-669): 10% increase (15% for high income)
    * Poor credit (<650): 5% increase (10% for high income)
  - Minimum CLI amount of $500 for all eligible accounts
  - Higher CLI caps for high income customers
  - Risk-adjusted CLI amounts based on risk_probability

Estimated Revenue Impact (12-month):
  Assuming 25% utilization of CLIs and 18% interest rate:
  Estimated additional interest revenue: $928,398.00

  Estimated default rate: 14.62%
  Estimated default loss: $754,197.53

Estimated net revenue impact: $174,200.47

CLI Distribution by Customer Value Tier:
  Low value customers (1845, 33.33%): $1012.02 avg CLI
  Medium value customers (1845, 33.33%): $2014.90 avg CLI
  High value customers (1846, 33.35%): $8150.82 avg CLI

Recommendations:
  1. Prioritize CLI offers to Segment 0 customers (Eligible-No Risk)
  2. For Segment 1 customers (Eligible-At Risk), consider smaller initial increases
  3. Monitor utilization of new credit lines to validate revenue projections
  4. Implement A/B testing of different CLI amounts to optimize acceptance rates
  5. Set up monitoring for early delinquency indicators in Segment 1 customers
